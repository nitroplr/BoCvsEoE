Hey Druids, now that you guys are coming into your own as an amazing caster ADPS/DPS I thought I would talk about the burns a bit.  The goal is always high uptime on burns, especially with burns like Group Spirit of the Great Wolf where you can have a 40% uptime on it since its such a long burn and with a short CD.  Spire of Nature is also a 10 min cd, so should also be used a lot in a raid night.  Really every time you guys see a bard epic go out is a decent enough time to hit your 10 minute burns.  If you know a tough phase is coming up holding them is fine, but it is best 90% of the time to just hit the stuff on cd with a bard epic.  And if popping burns is too much work for you, just macro it to your heals so they're at least getting used.  Spire and Group Spirit of the Great Wolf should be used together since they stack.  These two spells with a bard epic and enchanter spire has casters pretty close to 100% crit which means almost a 100% chance to hit for 8-10x an uncritted spell.  Throw in an MGB Auspice and we are over 100% chance to crit.

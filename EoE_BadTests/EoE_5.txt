I do not trust this test because I discovered that /resetaa only works during the session you are using it.  After I log my sk out and back in he gets given about 7k worth of aa's, I believe this is because he is a heroic toon so the autogranted heroic aa's get given to him upon logging back in.  One of these aa's is bold attacks which increases threat generated.

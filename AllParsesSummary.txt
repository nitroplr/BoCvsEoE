Does a max hasted 17 delay weapon swing more often than a 19 delay max hasted weapon? Yes.
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled (17 dly) : Average swings per second: 13446 / 5171 = 2.600
Obsidian Scimitar of War (19 dly) : Average swings / second = 13428 / 5843 = 2.298
2.298 / 2.6 = .8838 --- Expected: 17 / 19 = .8947
